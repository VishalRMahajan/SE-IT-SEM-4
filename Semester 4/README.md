# Semester 4 Labs

Welcome to the Semester 4 repository for the Information Technology Engineering program at St. Francis Institute of Technology, affiliated with Mumbai University. This repository contains the In-lab and Post Exp codes and outputs for various subjects including Python, Unix (OS), and Microprocessor Lab.

## Subjects Covered:
1. **Python Lab:** 
   - This lab introduces students to the basics of Python programming language and covers a range of topics including:
     - Introduction to Python, its features, and building blocks such as identifiers, keywords, indentation, variables, and comments.
     - Basic data types including numeric, boolean, and compound types, along with various operators like arithmetic, comparison, logical, and bitwise operators.
     - Control flow statements such as conditional statements (if, if...else) and looping structures (while loop, for loop).
     - Input/output functions, decorators, iterators, and generators.
     - Advanced data types like lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, strings, and arrays, along with built-in functions and operations.
     - Functions and object-oriented programming concepts including classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, and method overloading.
     - Exploring modules, packages, multithreading, and exception handling.
     - File handling operations, GUI programming, and database programming.
     - Data visualization, analysis, and web programming using Python libraries like Matplotlib, Pandas, and Flask.

2. **Unix (OS) Lab:**
   - This lab focuses on Unix operating system concepts, including:
     - Shell scripting
     - File manipulation
     - Process management
     - Basic system administration tasks

3. **Microprocessor Lab:**
   - This lab covers the following topics:
     - Study of PC motherboard technology, including South Bridge and North Bridge components, internal connections, and components used in computer systems.
     - Implementation of combinational circuits such as logic gates, half adder, full adder, MUX, and DeMUX.
     - Programming in 8086 assembly language for arithmetic and logical operations, including 16-bit BCD addition, logical expressions, and conversions.
     - Loop operations in 8086 assembly language for tasks like moving data between memory blocks, counting 1s and 0s, finding even and odd numbers, and searching for a given number.
     - String manipulation and procedure programming in 8086 assembly language for tasks like checking for palindromes, computing factorials, and generating Fibonacci numbers.
     - Interfacing with the 8086 microprocessor for tasks like interfacing with a seven-segment display, keyboard matrix, or digital-to-analog converter (DAC).

## Directory Structure:

Hey there! Just a **heads-up**, this repository is here to help you get a better grasp of the course content. But remember, it's super important to use these resources responsibly and play fair. Using them for anything shady like cheating or copying isn't cool and goes against the whole learning vibe we've got going on. So, let's keep it honest and rock those studies together!
